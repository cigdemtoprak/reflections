We create a repository in Github first.

git remote ==> to see if I have a remote repository in Cloud
git remote add remotename url
git remote -v (verbose) ==> to check the remote url
git push origin master

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- if I'm collabrating with others
- keep a copy of my work in cloud

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- in local I might be experimenting and have the latest changes, pulling automatically may overwrite my code.
