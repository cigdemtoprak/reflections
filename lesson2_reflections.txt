What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git init
we let git know where the repository files will be.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- it only contains the files you want to commit, not all files you work on. it lets you think twice if you really commit something.

git diff ==> difference between working directory and staging
git diff --staged ==> difference between staging and repository

git reset --hard
discard any changes to working directory and staging area

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can make sure I add all changes to staging area regarding the logical change
