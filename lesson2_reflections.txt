What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git init
we let git know where the repository files will be.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- it only contains the files you want to commit, not all files you work on. it lets you think twice if you really want to commit something.

git diff ==> difference between working directory and staging
git diff --staged ==> difference between staging and repository

git reset --hard
discard any changes to working directory and staging area

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can make sure I add all changes to staging area regarding the logical change

git branch ==> hangi branchler var onu gösteriyor, aktif olan *

git branch newbranchname ==> branch yaratiyor

git checkout newbranchname ==> new branchi aktif yapiyor, ilk yaratildiginda master branchin kodu var

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
- if I want to make different versions of the code or I want to try something without breaking stuff.
- context switching
- master branch: production quality
- branch is good for compartmentalizing
- branch is good if you're bored, and want to work on something new

Each commit knows its parent. They don't care about the branches. Branches store information about branches.

A commit is reachable if they are in the same line (geriye dönük olarak).

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
- we can understand and visualize which branch has which commits. the implementation structure.

Merging into the master-branch: new commit has now two parents.
Then we delete the joinie (coins in the example), new master has the added features and master changes, and all commits from both are reachable.

git merge master coins ==> merges coins into masters

git show commit-id ==> difference to parent

git branch -d coins ==> delete the coins label

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
- all changes from the new branch is incorparated into the master branch, the version resulting from the merge includes commits of both branches.

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
- resolving the conflicts manually gives us more control over the program.
