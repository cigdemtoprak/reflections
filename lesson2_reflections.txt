What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git init
we let git know where the repository files will be.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- it only contains the files you want to commit, not all files you work on. it lets you think twice if you really commit something.
